Aurae Runtime
========

Aurae is a low level distributed runtime system built for application and platform teams to build on top of.

## Replacing Systemd

Aurae aims to be a simplified alternative to [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) and the Kubernetes [kubelet](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubelet).

## MicroVMs and Containers

Aurae aims to unify microVMs, and container runtimes into a single simplified binary that runs on a host as a new pid 1.

## Security Focused

Aurae brings mTLS and strong identity to the lowest layer of the stack possible.
Schedule host daemons using the same mechanics you use to schedule pods.
